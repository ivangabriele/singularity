# Singularity

Yet another React UI.

**Do not use in a real application.** I'm publishing this early for demonstration purposes.

**Use it at your own risk.**

## No, Really, It Is Unstable

The API ~~may~~ will change wildly between versions.

## Why?

Because of very personal taste and reasons. After almost 10 years, I'm surprised to still have to ask myself which UI I
need to use while bootstrapping any React project. All the most popular open-source React UIs and Design Systems are not
pixel-perfect and are (in my opinion) quite ugly. And the less ugly ones are way too complex and far from how I would
write it in vanilla HTML, which doesn't make any sense. After 10 minutes of using any UI I feel obligated to waste a
hell lot of time customizing their look and feel. And as a developper, I have better things to do.

## What I expect Singularity to be

- A beautiful React UI, out-of-the-box.
- Not having to learn a full set of new properties and architecture while using a new React UI. The HTML semantic and
  structure is good enough for most cases, let's keep it simple.
