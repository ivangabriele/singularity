> Yet another React UI.

It's still in beta and largely undocumented but you can check [the Storybook][lnk-storybook] to get a look and feel.

## Why another damn React UI?

1. After almost 10 years, I still have to ask myself which UI I should use to bootstrap any new React project.
1. All the most popular open-source React UIs and Design Systems are far from pixel-perfect.
1. Most are (in my opinion) quite ugly.
1. The less ugly ones are way too complex and far from how I would write it in HTML, which doesn't make any sense.
1. After 10 minutes of using any UI I feel obligated to waste a hell lot of time customizing their look and feel.
1. As a developper, I have better things to do.

## Usage

```sh
npm i -E @singularity-ui/core
```

or

```sh
yarn add -E @singularity-ui/core
```

## Roadmap
