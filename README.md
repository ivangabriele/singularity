> Yet another React UI.

It's still largely undocumented but you can check [the Storybook][lnk-storybook] to get a look and feel.

## Why another damn React UI?

1. After almost 10 years, I still have to ask myself which UI I should use to bootstrap any new React project.
2. All the most popular open-source React UIs and Design Systems are far from pixel-perfect.
3. The best-looking ones are way too complex and far from how I would write it in HTML.
4. After 10 minutes using any UI I end up wasting a lot of time customizing their look and feel.
5. As a developper, I have better things to do.

## Usage

```sh
npm i -E @singularity/core
```

or

```sh
yarn add -E @singularity/core
```

## Roadmap

- Elements: Title, Subtitle, Parapraph, Quote, Code
- Full back-office demo
- Fields: Horizontal Radio
