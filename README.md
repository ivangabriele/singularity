Yet another React UI.

## Why?

Because of very personal taste and reasons. After almost 10 years, I'm surprised to still have to ask myself which UI I
need to use while bootstrapping any React project. All the most popular open-source React UIs and Design Systems are not
pixel-perfect and are (in my opinion) quite ugly. And the less ugly ones are way too complex and far from how I would
write it in vanilla HTML, which doesn't make any sense. After 10 minutes of using any UI I feel obligated to waste a
hell lot of time customizing their look and feel. As a developper, I have better things to do.

## Usage

```sh
npm i -E @singularity-ui/core
```

or

```sh
yarn add -E @singularity-ui/core
```

## Roadmap

- Contents/Table: Pagination (complete)
- Components: Modal
- Elements: Title, Subtitle, Parapraph, Quote, Code
- Fields: FileInput
- Layout: Menu (sidebar)
- Full back-office demo
